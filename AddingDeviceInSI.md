------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can add multiple storage systems at the same time, or add them one by one. To add multiple storage systems, the storage systems must be of the same type and share authentication credentials.

When you add block storage systems for monitoring, their status, capacity, configuration, and performance metadata is automatically collected and analyzed. When you add storage systems that manage both block and file storage, their status, capacity, and configuration metadata for file storage is also automatically collected and analyzed.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you have the Administrator role in IBM Storage Insights. For more information about roles, see Adding and removing users. Restriction:
* You must enter a user name and password that is used to connect to that storage system. These credentials must not include any blank spaces. In rare cases, special characters might also not be allowed by IBM Storage Insights. If you can't add a storage system for monitoring because of restricted characters, it's recommended that you change the credentials for the storage system and try adding it again. Then, open a ticket for the character limitation so that we can address it in a future update.
* If you add non-IBM storage systems, and the data collector is installed on a Windows system, any directory names must not start with any of the Windows reserved words such as these: CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, LPT9

As your email address or IBMid is used by internally by the data collector when you add storage systems, you must ensure that they do not start with any of the Windows reserved words.

## About this task
You can add multiple storage systems at the same time, or add them one by one. To add multiple storage systems, the storage systems must be of the same type and share authentication credentials.

When you add block storage systems for monitoring, their status, capacity, configuration, and performance metadata is automatically collected and analyzed. When you add storage systems that manage both block and file storage, their status, capacity, and configuration metadata for file storage is also automatically collected and analyzed.

Multiple ways to add and monitor IBM Storage Virtualize storage systems: You can add an IBM Storage Virtualize storage system for monitoring by using its management GUI or the IBM Storage Insights GUI.
* Using the management GUI: If you add a storage system by using its management GUI, you must enable Call Home with cloud services. A data collector is not required when you use Call Home with cloud services to monitor an IBM Storage Virtualize storage system. For more information, see Enabling Call Home with cloud services.
* Using the IBM Storage Insights GUI: If you add a storage system by using the IBM Storage Insights GUI, you must deploy or assign a data collector. For steps on how to add the storage system, see Procedure.

Metadata collection schedule and required roles:

* Status, configuration, and capacity metadata are collected by probes and aggregated once every 24 hours.
   * For DS8000Â® storage systems and their pools, the value for used capacity is collected once every hour. To customize that interval, contact IBM Support.
   * For some devices, additional probes are automatically run when specific events occur on those devices, or when many events are detected in a short time period. To avoid performance bottlenecks in those cases, probes are not run more than once every 20 minutes.
 
* Performance metadata is collected by performance monitors at the following intervals:
   * Every 5 minutes for IBM block storage systems
   * Every 5 minutes for Dell EMC Unity storage systems.
   * Every 5 minutes for Hitachi VSP storage systems.
   * Every 5 minutes for NetApp storage systems that are running ONTAP 9. Every 5 minutes for Pure storage systems.
   * Every 15 minutes for other Dell EMC block storage systems.
* The user name that IBM Storage Insights Pro uses to connect to a storage system must have the required privileges (or role) on that storage system to collect different types of metadata. For more information about the requirements for each type of storage system, see User roles for collecting metadata.
* When storage systems are added that manage only file storage or object storage, you schedule the collection of asset, capacity, and configuration metadata.

## Procedure
1. Choose one of the following options:
   * **IBM Storage Insights Pro** - Click Resources, and then click Block Storage Systems, or File Storage Systems, or Object Storage Systems or Unified Storage Systems. Click Add Storage Systems or Add Storage System.
   * **IBM Storage Insights** - On the NOC dashboard, click the Add Storage Systems tile.
2. Add the information to connect to and monitor the storage system.

## Results  
After you specify the information for adding storage systems, a task is added to the list of running tasks on the page banner. If a task fails for adding a storage system, it's added to the list of failed tasks on the page banner. You can retry the tasks that failed or clear them from the list. When you retry a task, the task is added to the list of running tasks.

After a storage system is successfully connected to IBM Storage Insights, a probe is automatically run to collect status and asset information. Additionally, the storage system is added to the default alert policy for the storage system type. For example, if you add a DS8000 storage system, it's automatically added to the alert policy called Default DS8000 policy. At any time, you can change which alert policy manages a storage system, or set a storage system to not be managed by any policy.
* DS8000 - Add DS8000 storage systems to get performance and asset, capacity, and configuration metadata analyzed so that you can detect performance issues, changes in storage usage, and plan for future storage needs.

## DS8000

Add DS8000Â® storage systems to get performance and asset, capacity, and configuration metadata analyzed so that you can detect performance issues, changes in storage usage, and plan for future storage needs.

Use the following information to add storage systems so that they can be monitored and that metadata can be collected, analyzed, and presented in the GUI.

**Host names or IP addresses** - The hostnames or IP addresses of the Hardware Management Console (HMC). Use hostnames if your IP addresses change regularly. For high availability, connect to both HMCs for each DS8000. Depending on what is supported in your environment, you can enter an Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) or IPv6 address. If you enter an IPv6 address, the preferred    representation is written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits. Example: 2001:DB95:0000:1234:0000:0000:5678:ABCD.

**User name and Password** - The user name, which is the same as the user name for the enterprise storage server network interface (ESSNI), and password for logging in to the storage system. The user must   have Monitor privileges for the storage system so that the metadata that is analyzed and presented in the GUI can be collected.

**User Name and PassTicket key** - The user name and RACF PassTicket for logging in to the storage system. This user name is the same as the user name for the enterprise storage server network interface (ESSNI). The user must have Monitor privileges for the storage system so that the metadata that is analyzed and presented in the GUI can be collected. For more information about RACF authentication, see The RACF PassTicket.
   * Tip: Why not create a dedicated user account to manage the monitoring of your storage systems more efficiently? So, instead of using an existing user account, create a new user account to connect to and collect metadata from your storage resources. Important:
   * Status, configuration, and capacity metadata are collected by probes and aggregated once every 24 hours.
   * For more detailed monitoring, the value for used capacity is collected once every hour at the storage system and pool levels. With this turbo boost to metadata collection, you can better monitor how fast pools are changing and take more timely action

---

# Setting the Device Statistics Collection Interval

IBM Storage Virtualize storage systems utilize a statistics collection interval managed within the firmware. This interval determines how often the system collects per-node statistics for volumes, managed disks, and nodes.

**Key Points:**
- The statistics collection interval is distinct from the performance monitoring interval set in IBMÂ® Storage Insights, which defaults to 5 minutes.
- Generally, IBM Storage Insights configures the statistics collection interval automatically. Adjustments are typically unnecessary.
- If adjustment is required, follow these guidelines:
  - Set the statistics collection interval on the IBM Storage Virtualize system to a value equal to or less than the current performance monitoring interval in IBM Storage Insights.
  - Ensure the interval set on the storage system is a divisor of the current performance monitoring interval in IBM Storage Insights to avoid missed samples.
  - For instance, with a default performance monitoring interval of 5 minutes in IBM Storage Insights, set the storage system's statistics collection interval to either 1 minute or 5 minutes using the `startstats` command. Using other intervals may lead to missed data points.

**Determining the Current Statistics Collection Interval:**
- Log in to the IBM Storage Virtualize storage system with Administrator or SecurityAdmin privileges.
- Execute the command: `lsdumps -prefix /dumps/iostats`
- Examine the file names returned, each indicating the timestamp of creation, to deduce the current interval.

**Adjusting the Statistics Collection Interval:**
- If necessary, use the `startstats` command on the IBM Storage Virtualize storage system to modify the collection interval. Example:
  ```bash
  startstats -interval 5
  ```

## Planning for IBM Storage Virtualize for Public Cloud

IBM Storage Virtualize is a proven software-defined storage solution used in SAN Volume Controller and IBMÂ® StorwizeÂ® family environments. IBM Storage Virtualize for Public Cloud extends this capability to hybrid-cloud or cloud-based deployments on IBMÂ® Cloud or Amazon Web Services (AWS).

### About this Task

The VPN IPSec site-to-site tunnel provides a secure communication network between your on-premises infrastructure and the cloud environment. Communication between private subnets is managed by access control lists (ACLs) configured during the VPN IPSec tunnel setup.

Typically, a bi-directional IPsec site-to-site tunnel is configured to include subnets containing the following IP addresses:

- On-premises IBM Storage Virtualize cluster and replication target
- Cloud-based IBM Storage Virtualize for Public Cloud cluster and replication target

To enable communication between IBM Storage Insights and IBM Storage Virtualize for Public Cloud using the IPsec site-to-site tunnel, ensure that the IP address of the server or virtual machine hosting the data collector is included in the tunnel configuration as one of the on-premises endpoints.

For example, in the AWS Management Console, define:

- External (internet-routable) IP address of the on-premises IPsec tunnel endpoint
- Subnets/IP addresses for:
  - On-premises server or virtual machine with the data collector
  - IBM Storage Virtualize cluster and replication target
  - IBM Storage Virtualize for Public Cloud cluster and replication target in AWS

Consult your network and firewall administrators for assistance in configuring this communication setup between IBM Storage Insights and IBM Storage Virtualize for Public Cloud.

### Troubleshooting Probing Issues and User Roles for IBM Storage Virtualize

#### Issue: Probing a SAN Volume Controller Cluster Fails When Cluster ID Changes

When a SAN Volume Controller (SVC) cluster ID changes, the initial probe after the change fails, but subsequent probes complete successfully. This commonly occurs when a cluster is rebuilt or recovered, generating a new cluster ID.

**Steps to Ensure Successful Probing After a Cluster ID Change:**
1. **Remove the Cluster from IBM Storage Insights:**
   - Before rebuilding or recovering the cluster, remove it from IBM Storage Insights.
   
2. **Rebuild or Recover the Cluster:**
   - Proceed with the rebuilding or recovery of the cluster.

3. **Add the Cluster to IBM Storage Insights:**
   - After the cluster is rebuilt or recovered, add it back to IBM Storage Insights.

#### User Roles for Collecting Performance Metadata from IBM Storage Virtualize

When adding IBM Storage Virtualize storage systems, ensure that the user credentials provided can collect performance metadata. The role required depends on the version of IBM Storage Virtualize.

**Versions Earlier than 8.3.1.2:**
- The user must have either the **Administrator** or **SecurityAdmin** role.

**Version 8.3.1.2 or Later:**
- The user can have any role, including the **Monitor** role.

**Important Notes for Version 8.3.1.2 or Later:**
- If performance metadata collection is stopped, the user's role determines whether collection can be automatically restarted.

**User Has Privileges to Start Collections:**
- If the user has the **Administrator** or **SecurityAdmin** role, the collection is automatically restarted and performance metadata is collected.

**User Does Not Have Privileges to Start Collections:**
- If the user has the **Monitor** role, IBM Storage Insights cannot automatically restart the collection. Manual intervention is required to restart the collection.

**Steps to Manually Start the Collection of Performance Metadata:**
1. **Log On to the Storage System:**
   - Use credentials of a user with the **Administrator** or **SecurityAdmin** role.

2. **Run the Command to Start Collection:**
   ```bash
   svctask startstats -interval 5
   ```
   - This command starts the collection of performance metadata with a 5-minute interval.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your SVC cluster is correctly probed after a cluster ID change and that performance metadata is collected appropriately based on user roles.
